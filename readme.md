# Expense Tracker
The [Expense Tracker](https://cosmic-chebakia-644d50.netlify.app) is a component based React JS application with CSS module styling to keep track of expenses. Users can add a new expense and filter them by year. I completed this project using Visual Studio Code in the React.js Complete Guide Udemy course.
